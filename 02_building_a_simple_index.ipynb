The paper provides an overview of a research line on the impact of diabetes on cognition that we started together 20 years ago, and that continues to this day. I will report how we more or less stumbled upon this topic, that was understudied, but proved to be of definite clinical relevance. I will discuss how we tried to establish animal models, how developments from clinical and experimental studies from around the world led us to reconsider our concepts, and how findings from research on diabetic neuropathy, insulin signaling in the brain, Alzheimer's disease and dementia, and vascular disease and stroke converged and helped to create new ideas and refute others. This voyage has not ended yet, because the ultimate goal is to offer patients with diabetes treatment that can protect them against accelerated cognitive decline. Although this could take another 20 years, the research from Willem Hendrik and his group brought us an important step in the right direction. </em></small><br>[ID: 23872409]"

Ten Brink AF, Hajos TR, van Bennekom C, Nachtegaal J, Meulenbelt HE, Fleuren JF, Kouwenhoven M, Luijkx MM, Wijffels MP, Post MW<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>The aim of this study was to identify predictors, available at admission, of physical independence at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation. Secondary aims were to identify predictors of functional gain and length of stay (LOS). We included 1310 adult stroke patients who were admitted for inpatient rehabilitation in five Dutch rehabilitation centres. Data on the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Clinical Rehabilitation at admission and discharge (physical and cognitive independence, mood, pain and fatigue), age, sex and in a subsample stroke characteristics as well were collected. A prediction model was created using random coefficient analysis. None of the stroke characteristics were independently associated with physical independence or functional gain at discharge, or LOS. Higher physical and cognitive independence scores and severe pain at admission were predictors of higher physical independence scores at discharge. Furthermore, lower physical independence scores, higher cognitive independence scores, less pain at admission and younger age predicted more functional gain. Finally, lower physical and cognitive independence scores at admission and younger age predicted longer LOS. Physical independence at admission was the most robust predictor for rehabilitation outcome in a Dutch rehabilitation setting. To a lesser extent, age, cognitive independence and pain predicted rehabilitation outcome after stroke. Treatment of cognition and pain should be taken into account during rehabilitation. Further work needs to be carried out to establish whether focusing on these factors improves outcome after rehabilitation.</em></small><br>[ID: 27749516]"

Half of the patients were not in work (28%) or were working less (22%) than pre-stroke. Ninety percent of those in fulltime employment post-stroke were satisfied with their occupational situation, against 36% of the unemployed participants. In regards to factors predicting RTW, global cognitive functioning (r = .19, Montreal Cognitive Assessment) and depressive symptoms (r = -.16, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) at two months post-stroke onset were associated with return to work within one year. Only global cognitive functioning was an independent predictor of RTW (11.3% variance, p = .013).

Understanding their relationship could inform treatment approaches to improve participation. We investigated the relationship between social cognition and participation in the long term after stroke. Of 395 patients participating in a large prospective cohort study, cross-sectional data were available at 3-4 years post-stroke of 118 patients on tests for emotion recognition, theory of mind, empathy, and behaviour regulation. Participation was assessed with the Utrecht Scale for Evaluation of Rehabilitation - Participation (USER-P). Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis were used to examine the relationship between social cognitive domains and participation. The majority suffered from minor stroke (83.1% scored NIHSS 0-4). Only behaviour regulation was related to participation restrictions in bivariate analysis, but social cognitive impairments did not predict participation restrictions in multivariate regression in this group. To conclude, in a sample of minor stroke patients with mild impairments in theory of mind, emotion recognition and behavioural control, there were no associations with restrictions in participation. Research should examine whether a relationship is present in patients with more severe stroke. In addition, measuring social aspects of participation is necessary to further unravel this relationship, to determine treatment targets for improving participation.</em></small><br>[ID: 31854264]"

Winter Y, von Merten S, Kleindienst HU<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Orientation depends on multi-modal information about the locally perceptible environment (local view) in many situations. We developed a behavioural paradigm for investigating visual orientation of flying bats based on a large-scale touch screen (1.2 m x 1.8 m). It functions by a grid of rows and columns of infra-red beams just in front of a screen with back-projected visual stimuli. Approaching animals interrupt the beams and thus permit automatic recording of the time and place of an animal's locational choice. We used it as a vertical touch surface. Installed as a horizontal walk surface, it may also serve as a more natural 'firm ground', circular arena analogue to the 'Morris water maze' for investigating orientation behaviour and spatial cognition from rodents to birds while offering automatic real-time recording of paths, times and latencies with enhanced possibilities to score details of motor behaviour and to control stimuli interactively. Bats offer a unique possibility to investigate the use of both echo-acoustic and visual information processing pathways for the process of self-localization and orientation. In our first experiment, a bat was presented with five identical targets, one central and four peripheral and had to choose the central target. After task acquisition, the array was shifted by the distance between targets, so that a formerly peripheral landmark was now in the absolute location of the formerly central target. At small inter-target distances, the bat 'went with' the array, and chose the new central target (at a new absolute location). With 30 cm or more of inter-target distance (60 cm across the landmark configuration), however, the bat went with absolute location, and chose a peripheral target. In experiment 2, the bat was presented with two landmarks 30 cm apart and an unmarked target located at midline beneath them. On tests, the landmarks either maintained training distance or were expanded to 50 cm apart. On such expansion tests, the bat chose most the location at the correct vector from the right landmark. This showed that the bat first identified a single landmark by the configuration and then applied a previously learnt vector (angle and distance) to locate the target. Glossophaga did not orient by pure angular geometry between landmarks and target.</em></small><br>[ID: 15661311]"

Ni H, Jiang YW, Tao LY, Jin MF, Wu XR<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Epilepsy in children is associated with a broad spectrum of cognitive deficits, which is associated with hippocampal mossy fiber sprouting. The underlying molecular mechanisms involved in mossy fiber sprouting in hippocampus following developmental seizures are not completely known. We studied the timing of cognitive dysfunction following neonatal seizures and the relation of this cognitive impairment to zinc transporter 1 (ZnT-1), 3 (ZnT-3), calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II), plasticity-related gene 1 (PRG-1) expression in hippocampus. A seizure was induced by inhalant flurothyl daily in neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats from postnatal day 6 (P6). Rats were assigned into the single-seizure group (SS), the recurrent-seizure group (RS, seizures induced in six consecutive days), and the control group. During P41-P46 and P85-P90, the rats were tested for spatial learning and memory abilities with automatic Morris water maze task. At P90, mossy fiber sprouting and gene expression in hippocampus were determined subsequently by Timm staining and RT-PCR methods. The escape latencies from the water maze were significantly longer in rats of RS group than those of the control and SS groups at d4 of the first maze test and at d3, d4 of the second maze test. As far as Spatial Probe Test was concerned, the frequency of passing through the platform quadrant was significantly decreased in RS group than that in control and SS groups in the entire two probe tests. In rats with recurrent seizures (RS group), there was an increased distribution of Timm granules in both the supragranular region of the dentate gyrus and the stratum pyramidale of CA3 subfield in RS group, while remaining barely visible in control and SS groups; the Timm scores in CA3 and dentate gyrus in the RS animals were significantly higher than that in the control and SS groups. RT-PCR densitometry analysis showed that the ratios of hippocampal ZnT-1 to beta-actin of SS and RS group were decreased significantly compared with that of control group. Meanwhile, CaMK II to beta-actin of RS group was markedly lower compared with those of SS and control groups. Our results suggest that the long-term adverse effects of recurrent neonatal seizures on cognition and mossy fiber sprouting may be associated with the down-regulated expression of ZnT-1 and CaMK II in hippocampus.</em></small><br>[ID: 19059322]"

Schoenfeld R, Moenich N, Mueller FJ, Lehmann W, Leplow B<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Although human spatial cognition is at the focus of intense research efforts, experimental evidence on how search strategies differ among age and gender groups remains elusive. To address this problem, we investigated the interaction between age, sex, and strategy usage within a novel virtual water maze-like procedure (VWM). We studied 28 young adults 20-29 years (14 males) and 30 middle-aged adults 50-59 years (15 males). Younger age groups outperformed older groups with respect to place learning. We also observed a moderate sex effect, with males outperforming females. Unbiased classification of human search behavior within this paradigm was done by means of an exploratory method using sparse non-negative matrix factorization (SNMF) and a parameter-based algorithm as an a priori classifier. Analyses of search behavior with the SNMF and the parameter-based method showed that the older group relied on less efficient search strategies, but females did not drop so dramatically. Place learning was related to the adaptation of elaborated search strategies. Participants using place-directed strategies obtained the highest score on place learning, and deterioration of place learning in the elderly was due to the use of less efficient non-specific strategies. A high convergence of the SNMF and the parameter-based classifications could be shown. Furthermore, the SNMF classification was cross validated with the traditional eyeballing method. As a result of this analysis, we conclude that SNMF is a robust exploratory method for the classification of search behavior in water maze procedures.</em></small><br>[ID: 19931570]"

Chauhan G, Ray K, Sahu S, Roy K, Jain V, Wadhwa M, Panjwani U, Kishore K, Singh SB<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Sleep deprivation (SD) upsurges intracellular levels of adenosine, impairs adult neuronal cell proliferation (NCP) and cognition while caffeine, a non-selective adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist improves cognition and adult NCP during SD. We examined the selective antagonistic effects of adenosine A1R using 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (8-CPT) on impairment of spatial reference memory and adult NCP during 48h SD. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were sleep deprived for 48h, using an automatic cage vibrating stimulus based on animal activity. Spatial reference memory was tested as a measure of cognitive performance employing Morris Water Maze. Rats were given 8-CPT dissolved in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), twice daily (10mg/kg, i.p.) along with 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) (50mg/kg/day, i.p.). The rats treated with 8-CPT showed significantly short mean latency and path-length to reach the platform compared to the SD rats. Consistent with these findings, 8-CPT-treated group was found to have significantly increased the number of BrdU, Ki-67 and doublecortin (DCX) positive cells. However, no significant difference was seen in NeuN expression in the Dentate Gyrus (DG). Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) expression in the DG and CA1 region was observed to decrease significantly after SD and be rescued by 8-CPT treatment. Furthermore, latency to reach platform showed a negative correlation with number of BrdU, DCX type-1 cells and BDNF expression in DG. Thus, it may be concluded that treatment with 8-CPT, an adenosine A1R antagonist during SD mitigates SD induced decline in spatial reference memory and adult NCP possibly via up regulation of BDNF levels in DG and CA1 regions.</em></small><br>[ID: 27623393]"

Steinberg F, Doppelmayr M<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Moving and acting underwater within recreational or occupational activities require intact executive functions, since they subserve higher cognitive functions such as successful self-regulation, coping with novel situations, and decision making; all of which could be influenced by nitrogen narcosis due to elevated partial pressure under water. However, specific executive functions that could provide a differentiated view on humans' cognitive performance ability have not yet been systematically analyzed in full-water immersion, which is a research gap addressed within this approach to contribute to a better understanding of nitrogen narcosis. In this study, 20 young, healthy, and certified recreational divers participated and performed three different executive-function tests: the Stroop test (Inhibition), the Number/Letter test (Task switching), the 2-back test (Updating/Working memory), and a simple reaction time test (Psychomotor performance). These tests were performed once on land, at 5-meter (m) water depth, and at 20-meter (m) water depth of an indoor diving facility in standardized test conditions (26°C in all water depths). A water-proofed and fully operational tablet computer was used to present visual stimuli and to register reaction times. Performance of the simple reaction time test was not different between underwater and land testing, suggesting that reaction times were not biased by the utilization of the tablet in water immersion. Executive functions were not affected by the shallow water immersion of 5-m water depth. However, performance scores in 20-m water depth revealed a decreased performance in the incongruent test condition (i.e., an index of inhibitory control ability) of the Stroop test, while all other tests were unaffected. Even though only one out of the three tested cognitive domains was affected, the impairment of inhibitory control ability even in relatively shallow water of 20-m is a critical component that should be considered for diver's safety, since inhibition is required in self-control requiring situations where impulsive and automatic behavior must be inhibited. Our interpretation of these selective impairments is based on a discussion suggesting that different neural networks within the central nervous system, which process specific executive functions, are affected differently by nitrogen narcosis.</em></small><br>[ID: 28676772]"

Anderson CO, Mason WA<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Behavior during competition for water was observed in 2 social groups of young rhesus monkeys (3 females, 3 males in each). Monkeys in one group were socially deprived and those in the other were socially experienced (raised with mother and agemates). Social status, based on dyadic recording of displacements at the water bottle, was predictive of a number of measures related to water consumption and social orientation in both groups, but this measure was less reliable and predictive for the experienced group than for the deprived groups, but this measure was less reliable and predictive for the experienced group than for the deprived group. A major reason for the comparatively low predictive value and reliability of status among experienced monkeys was their ability to influence the behavior of higher status members through responses directed to a 3rd party and other elaborate social strategies, many of which depended on responding to status relations between 2nd and 3rd parties. The fact that such strategies were only observed in the experienced group is a clear indication that the development of higher orders of social cognition is dependent on early social experience.</em></small><br>[ID: 97110]"

       "<strong>Dietary aluminum selectively decreases MAP-2 in brains of developing and adult rats.</strong><br>1992. Johnson GV, Watson AL Jr, Lartius R, Uemura E, Jope RS<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Administration of 0.3% aluminum in drinking water elevated serum aluminum concentrations 8-fold in rats. Further, chronic treatment with aluminum for 2-3 mon, in both developing and adult rats, significantly decreased the levels of MAP-2 in brain, as determined by quantitative immunoblot analysis. Aluminum treatment also decreased the level of brain spectrin, but only in the hippocampus of adult rats. These were selective effects, since the levels of tubulin, tau and the three proteins of the neurofilament triplet were unaltered. In the aluminum-treated adult rats MAP-2 levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampus and brainstem to 71% and 56% of control values, respectively. In developing rats, MAP-2 levels were significantly decreased in the cortex and brainstem (65 and 64% of control values, respectively) but not in the hippocampus. In support of these findings, immunohistochemical examination revealed that the intensity of hippocampal MAP-2 immunoreactivity was significantly decreased to 88% of control values with aluminum treatment in adult rats. To determine a possible mechanism by which MAP-2 levels are reduced, the effect of aluminum on calpain-induced proteolysis of MAP-2 was examined in vitro. At the aluminum concentrations tested, there was no apparent effect on calpain-induced proteolysis of MAP-2. In the developing rats, aluminum administration significantly increased the hippocampal cyclic AMP concentration, as reported previously in adult aluminum-treated rats, and decreased the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate concentration. These results demonstrate that chronic oral aluminum administration to rats selectively decreases the levels of MAP-2 in specific brain regions independent of calpain proteolysis. This decrease may be associated with increased cyclic AMP and protein phosphorylation, and the impairment of cognition previously observed in this model of aluminum intoxication.</em></small><br>[ID: 1331920]"

Vincent GP, Sepinwall J<br><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> <em>Orally administered AF102B, a selective muscarinic M1 cholinergic agonist, improved spatial learning in C57BL/10 mice in the Morris water maze. In four experiments in which all drug-treated animals received only one single administration of AF102B, improvement of acquisition depended on two factors: pretreatment time (tp) and dose. When a standard tp of 1 h was used, AF102B exhibited a U-shaped dose-response curve that is characteristic of many nootropic agents: learning was significantly improved by dose levels ranging from 0.1 to 1 mg/kg p.o. When the tp was extended out to as long as 8 days, two new effects emerged: (a) 1 mg/kg, the dose that had been the peak active dose at 1 h, exhibited a biphasic time course of action, being active at 1 h or at all tp intervals from 3 h to 5 days, but not at 1.5 h; (b) 0.03 mg/kg, a dose that had been inactive at a tp of 1 h, was active at all tp intervals from 3 h to 5 days, but not at shorter (1 and 2 h) or longer (6-8 days) tp intervals. In another experiment, animals received 0.03 mg/kg for 1-5 consecutive days: this dose level was active if the tp interval between the last dose and the learning session was 24-120 h, but not if it was only 1 h. Thus AF102B enhanced cognition in mice with a longer duration of action than reported for traditional muscarinic agonists.</em></small><br>[ID: 1472998]"

Cerebral embolisms were induced in male Wistar rats by injection of 800 microspheres 50 microns in diameter via the left internal carotid artery under 2% halothane anesthesia. Daily oral administration of nefiracetam (30 mg/kg/d) was started 9 days after embolization. Nefiracetam caused significant (p < 0.05) improvement of deficits in the learning of both water maze and passive avoidance tasks beginning 22 days after embolization of the rats. The drug also significantly restored decreases in cortical choline acetyltransferase (p < 0.05) and hippocampal glutamic acid decarboxylase activities (p < 0.01) in the embolized cerebral hemisphere and significantly increased cortical choline acetyltransferase (p < 0.05) and acetylcholinesterase activities (p < 0.05) in the contralateral cerebral hemisphere 21 days after embolization. These results demonstrate that nefiracetam improves cognitive dysfunction in the late phase in embolized rats and suggest that the effect is at least partly due to the increase in glutamic acid decarboxylase, choline acetyltranseferase and acetylcholinesterase activities.</em></small><br>[ID: 1492838]"
